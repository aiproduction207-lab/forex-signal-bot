elif confidence >= 70:
    entry_time = "Next 5 minutes"   # Good signal, wait for confirmation
elif confidence >= 60:
    entry_time = "Next 15 minutes"  # Moderate signal, be patient
else:
    entry_time = "Wait for setup"   # Weak signal, skip or wait more
```

## 🔐 Why Professional Format Matters

### ❌ Old Format Problems
```
"Signal: 🟢 CALL (Buy)"  ← Confusing term
"Strength: Strong"       ← Vague, subjective
Missing entry guidance   ← When to trade?
No price levels          ← Where to protect?
```

### ✅ New Format Benefits
```
"Action: BUY ↗️"         ← Crystal clear
"Confidence: 85%"        ← Objective, specific
"Entry Time: Now"        ← Actionable guidance
"Support: 1.08100"       ← Concrete price level
```
